VIA UNIVERSITY DNP1 Assignment 1 made by @Adrian-Cristian Militaru 

# Assignment 1
Minimum requirement
This assignment is open-ended, meaning that the minimum requirements are few, but there is plenty of 
room to expand upon the assignment, if you wish to challenge yourself. See optional suggestions in the 
next section.
As a minimum, you must be able to:
1. Register, log in, and out
2. Create a new post (when logged in), containing a title and a body (create a new page for this)
3. View all posts, i.e. just a header (either use the front page or create a new page)
4. Click on a post in the post overview, to go to a new page, where you can view the entire post.

Optional requirements
Below are ideas to expand upon the assignment. It is recommended to do them from the top down, 
however, not strictly necessary. Also, feel free to come up with your own features.

• The option for users to create sub-forums. 
o Each post must then belong to a sub-forum. A sub-forum could be owned by the creator, so 
the creator could be able to delete the sub-forum again, or otherwise moderate it, by 
deleting posts, etc.
• The feature to comment on posts
	o Each user can create one or more comments to each post.
• The feature to upvote/downvote posts
• The feature to upvote/downvote comments
• A profile page, where you can see stuff like
	o Overview of all your posts
	o Overview of all your comments
	o A total of points based on upvotes.
• The feature to comment on comments.
